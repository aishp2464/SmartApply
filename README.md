 Project Overview
SmartApply is an intelligent Job Recommendation System crafted to simplify and elevate the job-hunting experience. By centralizing job opportunities from leading platforms like LinkedIn, Indeed, and SimplyHired, and analyzing user resumes through modern technologies, SmartApply delivers personalized job recommendations. The platform grants direct access to curated job listings, saving time and increasing the efficiency of a job seeker's journey.

 Problem Statement
  The Challenge:
Today’s job search process can be both overwhelming and time-consuming. Candidates are required to manually navigate multiple job portals, create separate profiles, and search through endless listings to find a role that matches their skill set. This fragmented approach lacks efficiency and personalization.

 Our Solution:
SmartApply addresses this gap by building an AI-powered Job Recommendation System using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. It automates the job discovery process by fetching job listings from various trusted platforms, then filters and ranks them based on resume content provided by the user. With intelligent parsing and contextual matching, job seekers receive tailored job links that fit their profile and career goals—all from one unified interface.
